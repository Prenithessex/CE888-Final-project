# CE888-Final-project
In today's world, the number of databases and their sizes and complexity is constantly increasing. This makes it hard to be used especially for non-experts, those who have just caught up with the nature of the data, How the data has been stored in the database and also with exactly what query languages or user interfaces are used to access the data. One approach to solve this problem is by allowing the users to pose their queries in natural language. In this project, we will be loading, inspecting and cleaning a dataset taken from GitHub and based on the data inspected, we will research on and implement a machine learning framework best  suited for our data set. The framework, that in a general way will support the mapping of natural language searches to the corresponding SQL query and returns it. Our task here is to determine which Machine Learning gives the highest accuracy on predicting and mapping the input Natural Language question and returns the corresponding SQL query and implement it on the subset of data that we use.

The data is collected from 'A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task' from a GitHub competition https://yale-lily.github.io/spider
